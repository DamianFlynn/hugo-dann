The defined or expected configuration of the infrastructure resources that should exist in a given environment. Infrastructure as code tools, such as Terraform or Ansible, use a declarative approach to define the desired state of the infrastructure, which specifies the desired configuration of the resources, including their settings, dependencies, and relationships with other resources. The tool then automatically manages the infrastructure resources to ensure that they match the desired state, and can detect and apply any necessary changes to maintain the desired configuration. This approach promotes consistency, predictability, and scalability of infrastructure deployments, and enables easy versioning and tracking of infrastructure changes.
