Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that enables users to define and manage infrastructure in a declarative manner, supporting multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure. It allows for safe and predictable incremental changes to infrastructure, tracks changes for easy rollback, and integrates with other tools. Terraform simplifies infrastructure management and enables efficient, automated, and scalable infrastructure deployment.
