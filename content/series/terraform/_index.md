Infrastructure as code (IAC) is a software engineering approach that involves using code to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources, such as servers, databases, networks, and more. This approach enables developers and operations teams to automate infrastructure deployments and management, leading to more efficient, consistent, and scalable systems.

Terraform, an open-source IAC tool, is widely used to implement infrastructure using code, providing a declarative language to define the desired state of infrastructure resources, and automatically managing the infrastructure to ensure it matches the desired state.

In this series of posts, we will explore how to use Terraform to implement infrastructure using code in various cloud providers, including Azure, and Github, covering topics such as resource creation, updates, and destruction, state management, best practices, and more. By following along, you will gain a solid understanding of infrastructure as code principles, and learn how to leverage Terraform to build reliable and scalable infrastructure in the cloud.
