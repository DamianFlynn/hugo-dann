Hosting a website on GitHub Pages is a great way to share your work with the world. It's free, easy to set up, and requires no maintenance. You can host your website directly from your GitHub repository. This means you can use all the same tools you use for your code, like version control, issue tracking, and pull requests. You can also use GitHub Pages to host your website's source code alongside your rendered site. This is a great way to share your work with other developers.
